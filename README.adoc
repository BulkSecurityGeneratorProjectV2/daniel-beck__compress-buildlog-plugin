= Compress Build Log Plugin

== About

The Compress Build Log Plugin allows configuring jobs to have their build logs compressed.
For a long time, Jenkins has supported showing gzipped build logs on the UI and through its APIs, but had no facility to compress build logs.
This plugin implements that.

== Configuring build log compression

In a job configuration, check "Compress Build Log" and save.
You're done!
From then on, when builds finish, their build log will be compressed to a `log.gz` file, after which the original `log` file will be removed.
Jenkins will transparently access the `log.gz` file when the build log is viewed or downloaded.

== Pipeline compatibility

Pipeline support was dropped from version 1.3 of the plugin, as the changes to Pipeline plugins for https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/tree/master/jep/210[JEP-210] are incompatible with this plugin.

Earlier, version 1.2 of this plugin supported compressing full pipeline build logs.
https://plugins.jenkins.io/workflow-job[Pipeline: Job] plugin prior to version 2.26 stored per-step build logs.
This plugin did not support compressing these, only the main log file.
It could be configured either through the UI, or by adding `compressBuildLog()` to the `properties()` defined in the Pipeline DSL or Jenkinsfile.

== Issue Tracking

Issues for this plugin are tracked in the Jenkins project Jira at https://issues.jenkins-ci.org.

== Known Issues

Some plugins may assume that the build log is a text file and just append to it.
If that happens after this plugin rewrites the build log, the `log.gz` file will contain invalid contents.
